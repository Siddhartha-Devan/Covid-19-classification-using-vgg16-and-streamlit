Hey all, 
In this project I have used 7,500 images from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database, from this dataset.

I have classified the x-ray images into 3 categories namely, 
Covid positive, 
Covid negative and 
Other non-covid diseases.

I have used vgg16 based transfer learning for this project.
The ui has been developed using streamlit

To run the ui use the command streamlit run streamlit-app.py
